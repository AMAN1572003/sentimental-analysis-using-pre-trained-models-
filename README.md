Sentiment Analysis using RoBERTa, VADER, and Pipeline
This project implements sentiment analysis using three different techniques: RoBERTa (a variant of BERT), VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), and the Pipeline approach. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text. In this project, we utilize machine learning, lexicon-based, and simple rule-based approaches to analyze sentiments.
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves identifying and categorizing the sentiment expressed in a piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral. It has numerous applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research.

This project provides an implementation of sentiment analysis using three different methods:

RoBERTa: A state-of-the-art deep learning model for natural language understanding. RoBERTa is based on the transformer architecture and is pre-trained on vast amounts of text data.

VADER: A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically designed to analyze sentiments expressed in social media texts. It provides a fast and efficient way to perform sentiment analysis without requiring extensive training data.

Pipeline: A simple approach that combines preprocessing, feature extraction, and a classifier in a single pipeline. This approach is useful when a quick sentiment analysis solution is required without the need for extensive training or fine-tuning.
